/**
 * Resolve a Slack user identifier to its canonical uid, or `null` when it
 * cannot be resolved.
 *
 * Accepted forms (S6):
 *   - mention markup  `<@U094E5L4A15>` / `<@U094E5L4A15|zhuge>`
 *   - raw uid         `U094E5L4A15`
 *   - display name    `Z` / `Zhuge` / `@Zhuge` / `alice.kim` (case-insensitive).
 *     Matches BOTH the user's Slack display_name (`slackDisplayName`) AND their
 *     real_name (`slackName`) — users reference each other by the display name
 *     shown in chat, which often differs from the stored real_name.
 *
 * Resolution order is deliberate (uid precedence is a SECURITY property):
 *   1. mention markup → the embedded uid (definitive; Slack itself produced it)
 *   2. uid-shaped bare token → itself. A uid is the canonical, unspoofable
 *      identifier, so it MUST win over a display name. Otherwise a user who
 *      sets their Slack display name to another user's uid (`U0VICTIM`) could
 *      hijack `$user:U0VICTIM` / `$U0VICTIM:skill` and intercept references
 *      meant for the real uid owner.
 *   3. name match against the directory (display_name OR real_name,
 *      case-insensitive). NOT unique in Slack, so we fail closed on ambiguity:
 *      2+ DISTINCT uids sharing the name → null (require uid/mention). Both
 *      names of the SAME user collapse to one uid (not ambiguous).
 *   4. exact uid match in the directory (covers non-UID_RE-shaped ids).
